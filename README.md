ISS Anniversary Apps – Explore & Learn

Executive Summary (300 Words Max)

The ISS Anniversary Apps project is developed under NASA’s Space Apps Challenge to celebrate the legacy of the International Space Station (ISS). The challenge emphasizes creating educational and creative applications that highlight the ISS’s achievements and engage the public. Our proposed solution is an interactive application that allows users to explore the ISS virtually, learn about its scientific contributions, and engage in gamified learning activities.

The problem we address is the limited awareness and accessibility of ISS-related knowledge for the general public, especially younger generations. While vast data exists, it often remains inaccessible or unengaging for non-specialists. Our app solves this by combining educational content, real-time ISS data, and gamification through Unity-based mini-games. This ensures learning becomes both fun and memorable.

We selected this challenge because the ISS is a symbol of international collaboration and scientific progress, and its anniversary provides a unique opportunity to inspire future generations. By blending technology with education, our solution directly aligns with NASA’s objective of broad outreach and knowledge sharing.

Our approach ensures an engaging, educational, and scalable solution that not only celebrates the ISS but also inspires curiosity about space exploration.

Problem Definition (150 Words)

The core problem is the lack of engaging and accessible tools to communicate the importance of the International Space Station (ISS) to the wider public. While the ISS has produced groundbreaking scientific achievements, much of this knowledge remains limited to experts or scattered across technical platforms. For students and the general public, especially those with limited access to scientific resources, this creates a knowledge gap.

The relevance of this issue lies in the ISS’s role as a global scientific hub and symbol of collaboration. Without innovative ways to share its story, public awareness and inspiration risk declining, especially among younger generations. Addressing this gap is vital to sustain public interest in space exploration and motivate future scientists, engineers, and explorers.

Background & Literature Review (200 Words Max)

Several platforms provide ISS-related data, including NASA’s official APIs, live tracking sites, and educational outreach programs. Websites like NASA’s Spot the Station and mobile apps offer real-time tracking of the ISS’s location. Educational initiatives, such as online lesson plans and YouTube documentaries, provide valuable insights into the ISS’s contributions.

However, these solutions often face limitations. Tracking apps focus only on technical data without educational engagement. Documentaries and lesson plans provide knowledge but lack interactivity. Gamified science applications exist in other domains (like space quizzes or VR experiences), but few specifically integrate ISS knowledge with real-time data and interactive exploration.

Research shows that gamification and interactive learning significantly improve knowledge retention and student engagement. Studies in educational technology highlight how visualization tools and serious games can bridge the gap between complex scientific data and learner understanding.

Our project builds on this foundation by merging gamification with real ISS data. Unlike existing solutions, it offers a holistic experience where users can explore, learn, and play in one platform. This unique integration positions our app as an innovative contribution to ISS education and outreach.

Methodology

Research & Planning – Gather ISS datasets from NASA APIs, documentaries, and official resources.

Design – Create user-friendly UI/UX with accessible navigation for exploration.

Development –

Front-End: Build the app interface using Unity (for games) and optional web/mobile frameworks.

Data Integration: Connect ISS APIs for real-time visualization.

Gamification: Develop Unity mini-games that teach ISS history and science.

Testing – Pilot the app with sample users for feedback.

Deployment – Release a working prototype for public engagement.

Solution

Our solution is a hybrid educational and entertainment application. Users can:

Explore the ISS through interactive maps and visuals.

Access real-time ISS data integrated from NASA APIs.

Play Unity-based games to learn about ISS missions, astronauts, and experiments.

This aligns with the challenge by celebrating the ISS’s anniversary through an accessible, engaging tool that reaches diverse audiences.

Value Proposition

The ISS Anniversary App transforms static data into an interactive, memorable experience. Unlike existing apps, it integrates real-time data with gamified learning, ensuring long-term engagement. For NASA, it provides a powerful outreach tool; for users, it offers an accessible and enjoyable way to learn about space.
