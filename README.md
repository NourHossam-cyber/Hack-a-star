ISS Anniversary Apps – Explore & Learn

Executive Summary (300 Words Max)

The ISS Anniversary Apps project is designed under NASA’s Space Apps Challenge 2025, focusing on celebrating the International Space Station (ISS) through creative and educational solutions. Our solution aims to bridge the gap between the vast amount of ISS knowledge and the limited ways in which the general public, especially young learners, can access and engage with it.

The problem we tackle is the lack of engaging and interactive platforms that bring ISS data, achievements, and stories to life. Existing resources, while informative, often remain static, overly technical, or fragmented. To address this, we propose an innovative application that combines real-time ISS data integration, interactive visualization, and Unity-based gamification.

Through this app, users can virtually explore the ISS, understand its modules and experiments, and learn about the astronauts’ lives aboard. The Unity mini-games allow users to engage in fun, educational missions—such as repairing modules, managing resources, or completing science experiments—while learning about real ISS facts.

We chose this challenge because the ISS symbolizes international collaboration, innovation, and human achievement in space. Its anniversary is not only a milestone to celebrate but also an opportunity to inspire curiosity and future generations in science and technology.

By blending interactive design, gamification, and real data, our app ensures a scalable, engaging, and accessible solution that effectively meets the challenge requirements and amplifies ISS outreach globally.

Problem Definition (150 Words)

The International Space Station has been central to scientific discovery and international cooperation for over two decades. However, awareness and understanding of its significance remain limited among the general public. Most ISS-related resources are scattered across technical platforms, scientific papers, or static websites, making them inaccessible or unappealing to non-specialists, particularly students.

This problem is critical because without accessible educational tools, public engagement with the ISS risks decline, reducing its inspirational power for future scientists and engineers. At a time when space exploration is expanding rapidly, bridging this knowledge gap is essential to foster interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).

Our project directly addresses this issue by creating an interactive, gamified, and educational platform that makes learning about the ISS both accessible and exciting.

Background & Literature Review (200 Words Max)

Existing ISS-related solutions fall into three main categories:

Tracking Tools – Apps and websites like “Spot the Station” show ISS position but provide little educational content.

Educational Resources – Lesson plans, videos, and documentaries deliver information but lack interactivity.

Science Games – General space-themed games engage users but rarely connect with real ISS data or learning outcomes.

Research in educational technology consistently shows that gamification enhances learning outcomes, retention, and engagement. For example, Gee (2003) emphasizes how video games can teach systems thinking and problem-solving. NASA’s own STEM outreach programs demonstrate the potential of interactive tools to inspire young learners.

Despite these efforts, there is no unified solution that merges real-time ISS data, interactive exploration, and gamified education into a single platform. Our project fills this gap by combining the strengths of visualization, live data, and game-based learning, ensuring that users both enjoy and retain knowledge about the ISS.

Methodology

Research & Planning: Collect ISS datasets from NASA APIs and curate educational content.

Design: Build intuitive UI/UX and storyboard Unity-based games.

Development:

Use Unity for gamified modules.

Integrate ISS APIs for real-time tracking and data.

Add visualization tools for station modules and science experiments.

Testing: Conduct usability testing with pilot users.

Deployment: Release prototype with GitHub documentation and demo.

Solution

Our app combines interactive ISS exploration, gamification, and real-time data visualization. Users can:

Explore ISS modules in a 3D environment.

Play educational Unity games linked to real ISS science.

Track the ISS live via NASA APIs.

Steps: prototype development, content integration, game testing, and public release.

Value Proposition

Unlike traditional apps, our solution merges fun and learning. It transforms static ISS data into engaging experiences. Users gain both entertainment and knowledge, while NASA achieves broader outreach. The combination of gamification and real-time data makes our solution stand out as both innovative and impactful.
